GreasePencil
=============
*GreasePencil*: /A Caffeinated WindowsScript Framework/

### What Is It? ###
GreasePencil adds the flavor of browser-based JavaScript frameworks to JScript
and WindowsScript. Additionally, GreasePencil brings a library of functionality
specific to the everyday needs of script writers in the world of business. This
includes database and reporting functionality as well as integration with
Microsoft Office.


### The Name ###
GreasePencil was named such because grease pencils are what one would normally 
use to write on glass. The phrase WindowsScript makes me think of this for some
reason. Just as grease pencils can be used to write script on windows,
GreasePencil can be used to enhance WindowsScript.
