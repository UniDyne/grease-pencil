{"name":"GreasePencil","tagline":"GreasePencil: A Caffeinated WindowsScript Framework","body":"### What Is It?\r\nGreasePencil adds the flavor of browser-based JavaScript frameworks to JScript\r\nand WindowsScript. Additionally, GreasePencil brings a library of functionality\r\nspecific to the everyday needs of script writers in the world of business. This\r\nincludes database and reporting functionality as well as integration with\r\nMicrosoft Office.\r\n\r\n### The Name\r\nGreasePencil was named such because grease pencils are what one would normally \r\nuse to write on glass. The phrase WindowsScript makes me think of this for some\r\nreason. Just as grease pencils can be used to write script on windows,\r\nGreasePencil can be used to enhance WindowsScript.\r\n\r\n### Why Not Node.js? Or PowerShell?\r\nThis project is not an attempt to create a generic JavaScript environment but is an effort to create a framework for business-related tasks in a Windows environment. As such, Windows already includes JScript as part of Windows Scripting Host. The roots of this project predate both Node and PowerShell.\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nGreasePencil is currently developed and maintained by Darien O. Brown (@unidyne). Some of the JScript language extensions used in this project were derived from early versions of Prototype and/or MooTools.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
